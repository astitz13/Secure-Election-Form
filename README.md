# Secure Election Form

This script will allow you to run more secure and anonymous elections for your organizations through Google Forms. By using randomized verification codes, this system will allow you to check to make sure each person only submitted one response while keeping the user's identity fully anonymous to prevent retribution for voting choices. While Google Forms might already have options to limit to one submission, this also prevents users from using multiple email addresses to submit multiple votes, verifying that every vote counts equally while keeping submission anonymous.
